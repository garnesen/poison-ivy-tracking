        <li>Poison ivy vines that climb vertical surfaces, typically attaching with “hairy” aerial roots </li>
        <li>The amount of hairy roots produced varies greatly from a few to a dense red mat of aerial roots</li>

        <li>When the climbing vine reaches the top of vertical surface it will extensively branch, forming a dome-like canopy</li>
